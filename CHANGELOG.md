  is started by the [custom_startup.sh](/startup/custom_startup.sh) script.
* Jupyter is available.
* No longer need to authenticate when opening VNC Desktop.
* User is now a sudoer, can install debian packages, and user password
  can be set at container instantiation (via the environment variable USER_PW).
