# Workspace Nouveau
A new workspace image for [DTaaS](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/DTaaS).

# Current state
Based on the KASM core ubuntu image.
Added VSCode service with [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server), is started by the [custom_startup.sh](/startup/custom_startup.sh) script.
Still need to convince KASM to expose the code-server port.
Still need to install Jupyter.
