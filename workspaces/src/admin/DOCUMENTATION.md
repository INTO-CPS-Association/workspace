# Admin Service Documentation

The admin service is a FastAPI-based REST API that provides service discovery
and management capabilities for the DTaaS workspace.

## Overview

The service runs on port 8091 (configurable via `ADMIN_SERVER_PORT` environment
variable) and is proxied through nginx. It supports path prefixes for multi-user
deployments, allowing routes to be accessible at `/{path-prefix}/services`.

## Endpoints

### GET /services

Returns a JSON object containing information about all available workspace
services.

**Request**:

```bash
# Without path prefix
curl http://localhost:8080/services

# With path prefix
curl http://localhost:8080/{path-prefix}/services
```

**Response**: Status 200 OK

```json
{
  "desktop": {
    "name": "Desktop",
    "description": "Virtual Desktop Environment",
    "endpoint": "tools/vnc?path={PATH_PREFIX}%2Ftools%2Fvnc%2Fwebsockify"
  },
  "vscode": {
    "name": "VS Code",
    "description": "VS Code IDE",
    "endpoint": "tools/vscode"
  },
  "notebook": {
    "name": "Jupyter Notebook",
    "description": "Jupyter Notebook",
    "endpoint": ""
  },
  "lab": {
    "name": "Jupyter Lab",
    "description": "Jupyter Lab IDE",
    "endpoint": "lab"
  }
}
```

**Notes**:
- Service endpoints are relative paths that should be appended to the base
  workspace URL
- When using path prefixes, the prefix is automatically prepended to all routes
- Empty string endpoints indicate the service is available at the root path

### GET /health

Health check endpoint for monitoring service availability.

**Request**:

```bash
# Without path prefix
curl http://localhost:8091/health

# With path prefix  
curl http://localhost:8091/{path-prefix}/health
```

**Response**: Status 200 OK

```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### GET /

Root endpoint providing service metadata and available endpoints.

**Request**:

```bash
# Without path prefix
curl http://localhost:8091/

# With path prefix
curl http://localhost:8091/{path-prefix}
```

**Response**: Status 200 OK

```json
{
  "service": "Workspace Admin Service",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "/services": "Get list of available workspace services",
    "/health": "Health check endpoint"
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Service Discovery Flow

1. User accesses `http://{domain}/{path-prefix}/services` (or `/services` without prefix)
2. nginx receives the request and routes it to the admin service on port 8091
3. Admin service reads the `services_template.json` file
4. JSON response is returned to the client
5. Path prefix is configured via CLI argument when starting the service

### Components

- **FastAPI Application** (`src/admin/main.py`): Core service implementation
- **Services Template** (`src/admin/services_template.json`): JSON template
  defining available services
- **nginx Configuration** (`startup/nginx.conf`): Reverse proxy routing
- **Startup Script** (`startup/custom_startup.sh`): Service bootstrap and
  monitoring

## Environment Variables

- `ADMIN_SERVER_PORT`: Port for the admin service (default: `8091`)
- `PATH_PREFIX`: Optional path prefix for API routes (can also be set via CLI `--path-prefix` argument)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
cd workspaces/src/admin
poetry install
poetry run pytest --cov=admin --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Code Quality and Coverage

**Run pylint for code quality analysis:**

```bash
cd workspaces/src/admin
poetry run pylint src/admin tests
```

**Run tests with coverage analysis:**

```bash
cd workspaces/src/admin
poetry run pytest --cov=admin --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```

This will generate a coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html` and display a
summary in the terminal.

### Running Locally

**As a service:**

```bash
cd workspaces/src/admin
export ADMIN_SERVER_PORT=8091
poetry run workspace-admin --path-prefix dtaas-user
```

**As a CLI utility:**

```bash
cd workspaces/src/admin
poetry install

# Run the service
poetry run workspace-admin

# Run with custom host and port
poetry run workspace-admin --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000

# Run with path prefix for multi-user deployments
poetry run workspace-admin --path-prefix dtaas-user

# List services without starting the server
poetry run workspace-admin --list-services

# Run with auto-reload for development
poetry run workspace-admin --reload

# Show help
poetry run workspace-admin --help
```

The CLI interface makes the admin service work like a system utility similar to
glances, allowing easy command-line operation and service listing.

### Adding New Services

To add a new service to the workspace:

1. Update `services_template.json` with the new service definition:

```json
{
  "new_service": {
    "name": "New Service Name",
    "description": "Description of the service",
    "endpoint": "path/to/service"
  }
}
```

2. The service automatically reads and processes the template - no code changes required

## Integration with DTaaS

The `/services` endpoint enables the DTaaS frontend to:

1. Dynamically discover available workspace services
2. Display service shortcuts to users
3. Support different workspace configurations without hardcoded service lists
4. Handle multi-user deployments where each user has different available
   services

This replaces the previous approach of hardcoding service endpoints in the
frontend configuration, enabling more flexible workspace deployments.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Service registry for dynamic service registration
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Service health monitoring and status reporting
- Custom service definitions per workspace type
- Web application firewall integration for zero-trust security
